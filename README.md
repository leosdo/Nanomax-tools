# Nanomax tools
This page presents a number of tools for users/staff while conducting the experiments in NanoMAX.

## version 0.0.  - Nov24
Capabilities introduced: 
- cif tools: read .cif file and calculates absorpition spectra (5 to 28 keV), XRD, and diffraction angles for specied energy
- conversion tools: aimed to calculate an (*h k l*) for multiple energies
- Pilatus2Robot: find the gamma and delta angles from a WAXS conditions to high resolution peak diffraction in the robot arm
